### Download the engine and it's container

- This project works only x86 windows defender(mpengine)

  You can download newest windows defender at here

- Cause the 1.1.16000.6 version has MS Debug Symbol, I develope this project with that version.

  To use this project,  you should use 1.1.16000.6 version of mpengine, since the dependency, and you can download this at here.

- You can use other arch or versions of mpengine, but it may not works on this project becuase of the "internal structures" or "functions parameters", etc.. may different.
